                        <p class="palanquin-regular">
                            This <a href='https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07328v1' target="_blank">research paper</a> states that “only 5.7% of the total hours of existing music datasets come from non-Western genres” for the datasets they analyzed for their project/ research. 
                            In the training data they analyzed used by Jukebox, a music generation application, they noticed biases towards western classical music as well. 
                            If music generation algorithms are lacking, so are music recommendation models, because it is very likely that the datasets used to train the generation models are similar to the datasets contained by streaming platforms. 
                            And that’s not to say that such datasets don’t exist, in fact the same project uses a dataset called “ the MTG Saraga Srinivasamurthy et al. (2021) annotated dataset which is built on CompMusic offering 50 hours of audio” which contains information about the ragam and talam. 
                            This is interesting because Spotify did make efforts to market to India in a different way than they did for the rest of the world. 
                            This is made obvious by the fact that the free tier for Spotify in India includes features like unlimited skips and selecting a song to play for the queue, which does not exist in America’s free tier. 
                            In addition, Spotify in India asks users to choose the languages they want to listen to before picking genres, a luxury not offered to other countries. 
                            Furthermore, according to this <a href='https://musically.com/2021/04/07/spotifys-six-point-strategy-for-cracking-india' target="_blank">article</a>, “ Spotify has between 15 to 20 million MAUs in India,” (Gurbaxani 2021). 
                            In order to gain a wider audience, they focused on catering to different languages which did have its initial benefits. 
                            They focused marketing campaigns in regions based on language. 
                            To market to the Telugu community, they used actors from the show Bigg Boss to spread word of the app. 
                            However, music cannot be classified just by language. Even within one language, as is with American music, music can have various qualities such as melody and rhythm that allow for more nuanced classification and recommendation.
