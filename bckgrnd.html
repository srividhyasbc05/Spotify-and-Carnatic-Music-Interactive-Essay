                        <br>
                        <p class="palanquin-regular">I’ve been wanting to expand my music taste for about a year now, as I grew up listening to Tamil film music all my life, playlists curated by my parents and played in the car as we drove anywhere, everywhere. 
                            However, as I grew older, I began to feel separated from my peers because it seemed they all listened to artists I’d never heard of and bonded over their shared musical interests. 
                            It took me some time to get over my embarrassment of listening to Indian music that wasn’t Bollywood, however, that didn’t stifle my curiosity and yearning for some new music. 
                            I noticed that the music I listened to often evoked nostalgia but when I needed to do my physics homework, getting transported back into the car as I watched the trees pass by wasn’t the most ideal. 
                            So I turned to Spotify. 
                            I tried listening to the daily mixes, to the discover weekly, the mixes. 
                            But I noticed that since I listened to a lot of Tamil music, my recommendations were just combinations of random songs from Tamil artists and other Indian languages from the region. 
                            I wasn’t getting music of the same vibe of the music I did curate from my parents’ playlists. I found myself having to ask my friends to recommend music and artists, sending them my favorite playlists, asking them to listen, and recommend music from that. 
                            While that did yield results, I found the whole process of discovering new music a daunting and often unrewarding task. However, once I started listening to some American artists like Billie Eilish and Conan Gray, I noticed I was discovering new artists in Spotify’s recommendations every time I listened. 
                            Take a look at the screenshots below. Notice how the playlists featuring mainly American music are categorized by mood, while anything with Indian artists tends to be categorized by the year/decade, or just the language. Even though the playlists I do have are categorized by mood, the corresponding playlists don’t reflect the same organization I have with my music.  
                            So I began to wonder how Spotify analyzes its tracks.
