This is an interactive essay I created about algorithmic bias in spotify for my Ethics and Technology final!
The essay is essentially a click-through walk through the portions of the essay with clickable links to my sources
The interactive portions include the explanation of ragam in Carnatic music and the comparison of Spotify metadata and ragam analysis on a spotify playlist
- Unfortunately Spotify discontinued their audio features and ausio analysis features of their web API, but I have provided the code here for anyone interested :)
Color palette was derived from coolors
code written and ui designed by me :)
