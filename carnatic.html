                                Ragam can be defined as the melody of the musical piece. 
                                It is a set of rules that creates a melodic framework. 
                                The reason to define it this way is because certain ragams may have the same notes, but depending on the rules, can produce different music.
                                A ragam is a set of notes <strong>(swarams)</strong> whose rules follow their ascending and descending progressions <strong>(arohanam/ and avarohanam)</strong>. 
                                There are 12 notes in every octave of carnatic music. 
                                Of the 7 swarams: 
                                <br>
                                <strong>Sa (low tonic), Ri, Ga, Ma, Pa, Da, Ni, and Sa (high tonic)</strong>  
                                <br>
                                the notes Ri, Ga, Ma, Da, and Ni have two variations. 
                                These do have official names but for the sake of this overview, one can simplify it and say that one of those two variations is a relatively ‘happy’ note, while the other a ‘sad’ note. 
                                These terms can also be called raga, swara, arohana, and avarohana, however I will be using the terms I grew up with. 
                                Each ragam has a few characteristic phrases that are meant to be used to identify the ragams of compositions.
                                They are known as <strong>swara sancharas</strong>
                                For example, in the ragam Neelambari, there is a very common swaram pattern in the varnam Senthil Mevum notated as 
                                <br>
                                <strong>S P m G m | S N P m G m | S S N p m G m R P m|</strong>
                                <br>
                                 that is used often in improvisation and even in film songs. 
                                The particular fall from N to P is the characteristic of this ragam. 
                                These phrases are crucial in conveying the feeling of the ragam. 
                                These feelings in particular may be subjective but for me, in both the varnam aforementioned and the film song Vaasi Vaasi from the movie Thiruvilaiyadal convey a pleading, yearning emotion to me.

                            <p class="palanquin-regular">
                                Shruti is defined as the “interval between two notes such that the difference between them is perceptible” when translated to English from the NatyaShastra, a text from the Vedic age on the dramatic and performing arts. 
                                Shruti can be considered setting of the tune using the tonic notes Sa (low) and Sa (high) and he mid note Pa. 
                                According to this <a href= "">research paper</a> by Gopala K. Koduri et al. on computational approaches to understanding melody in Carnatic Music (more on that later), 
                                “In fact, it is a well accepted notion that a note (swarasthana) is a region rather than a point [7,27]. 
                                Thus, a fixed, stable tuning for each note is not as important as it is in, say, western classical music. 
                                In addition, Sa, the tonic, can be any frequency.
                                It depends on the comfort of the singer or the choice of the instrument player” (Koduri et al. 2011). 
                                You can see this in the interactive demonstration on the right. 
                                The shrutis don’t really align with how the piano is set up.

                            <p class="palanquin-regular">
                                But ragam is arguably the most important feature in classifying Carnatic music. 
                                Let’s dive deeper into characteristics of ragam. 
                                Another characteristic feature of ragam is <strong>gamakkam</strong>. 
                                Gamakkams can be identified as vibratos or sliding movements between notes. 
                                They can be represented by discrete notes but when sung, they form a continuous pattern that is difficult to represent on paper. 
                                There are 15 documented types of gamakkams (which I unfortunately do not know much about), and identifying them is crucial to classifying music because these gamakkams are what distinguish the emotion of the song. 
                                Songs can have the same ragam but elicit different emotions and these gamakkams can help make distinctions between songs.
