                        <p class="palanquin-regular">
                            This may seem very bleak but there are a plethora of things that can be done to remedy this issue. 
                            Kashwi Aggarwal in her article <a href="https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/spotifys-desi-dilemma-why-is-spotify-s-fastest-growing-market-stuck-in-a-bollywood-loop-230f20f5de4a">“Spotify’s Desi Dilemma”</a> suggests that Spotify should talk to experts and manually tag tracks with the required granularity to distinguish between different forms of music such as Carnatic vs contemporary. 
                            This could involve annotating the data of the songs SPotify does have in its database, much like the datasets used by those trying to create Carnatic music generators or analyzers. 
                            Aggarwal suggests taking inspiration from Youtube and their <strong>deep candidate generation model</strong> to capture nuanced differences. 
                            Candidate generation basically takes a very large list of potential candidates and narrows it down to a few hundred and populates its pages based on your most recent watches. 
                            Aggarwal also notes that she feels as though Spotify is not using its <strong>user curated playlists</strong> to test its models and analyze why certain songs are grouped together. 
                            This could not only help refine their model but also help with generating better recommendations. 
                            She emphasized, however, that global music has to be treated with <strong>cultural sensitivity</strong>, since music transcends linguistic boundaries when it comes to the emotions elicited. 
                            Not all Hindi songs are the same, not all Hindi songs are Bollywood.

                        </p>
                        <p class="palanquin-regular">
                            The research paper on computational approaches to understanding ragam states that <strong>top down research</strong> must be done to make sense of audio data. 
                            This means consulting music scholars of which India has many, to understand the <strong>ontologies</strong> of the music listened to. 
                            Top down research is also crucial to annotating datasets accurately to help with training the algorithm. 
                            An example of this can be seen with Pandora. 
                            While Pandora has a smaller dataset of songs compared to Spotify, over 450 attributes were defined by trained musicologists before being fed into the algorithm.
                        </p>
                        <p class="palanquin-regular">
                            While music is a relatively small sphere of the world and the effects of this misclassification seem insignificant, on a global scale, the <strong>homogenization of culture</strong> can eventually lead to the loss of knowledge on what makes us so diverse. 
                            Histories and cultures will be neglected, even though that is what makes every individual unique. 
                            These algorithms have so much power, power that can be used to spread more awareness and allow for history to break geographical bounds, and allow for people to engage with other cultures authentically.
