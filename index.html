                        OVERVIEW
                        <br>
                        <p class="palanquin-regular">
                          This is an interactive essay exploring how Spotify analyzes its music through its algorithm and how it is an inappropriate model for non Western nmusical traditions,
                        heavily referencing Carnatic music. This essay explores the inner workings of the Spotify algorithm as well as Carnatic music,
                        culminating in an illustration of the effects of such algorithms on the population.
                        The focus is on the ethical and societal implications of algorithmic bias in such music algorithms. 
                        This essay concludes with a short call to action on research being done and actions Spotfy can take to improve their algorithm!
