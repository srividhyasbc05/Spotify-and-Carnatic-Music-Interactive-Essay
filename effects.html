                            These recommendation algorithms were made with the intention of personalizing one's listening experience and allowing for discovery, when, in reality, they are doing the opposite. 
                            They attempt to make finding music more convenient by analyzing your current music taste with their metadata to provide similar music that you may not have heard of. 
                            As you listen, Spotify makes new playlists with similar artists that you can listen to to find new artists and new music. 
                            But with convenience, exploration is limited. 
                            In this article in the MIT Technology Review, author Tiffany Ng says that people are expecting too much out of the algorithm, by expecting exploration to come with convenience, where work does not have to be put into discovering new music. 
                            With at least 30% of the music streamed being recommended by AI, the discovered playlists are generally the same songs with the same kind of sound. 
                            In an interview with Glenn McDonald, the primary engineer of this algorithm, he explains that “Spotify thinks that even if we say we want to listen to something new, we always return to what’s familiar. 
                            While personalization is meant to make navigating an information overload less overwhelming, it is taking away from the active state of curiosity. 
                            Even to break free from the algorithm and explicitly state that you want to listen to new music, your notion of new music can be shaped by what you come across. 
                            If you keep coming across the same thing, you are probably just going to want that thing. 
                            The algorithm is based on math, without the personality that comes with personal recommendations. 
                            When my friends recommend artists to me, they always tell me why they think I would like that artist or that music based off of what they know about me, which is more nuanced than math could ever hope to replicate. 
                            However, as we see with this exploration of Carnatic music, the math used to determine similar songs is wrong from non-Western music paradigms which serves only to alienate users and listeners of those genres even more, when Spotify is unable to provide them recommendations accurately based on the qualities of the songs they listen to.

                            According to this article, “Spotify's shuffle algorithm incorporates weighted randomness, favoring frequently played or highly rated tracks. While this aligns with user preferences, it conflicts with expectations of true randomness” which takes away from the whole act of discovering new music. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="palanquin-regular">
                            Since these algorithms are based on data and user behavior for the most part, they have a limited dataset for non-western music, so the algorithm perpetuates inherent biases towards Western music.  
                            Due to the nature of the algorithm, Spotify can cater only to certain demographics, which leads to a homogenization of music tastes. 
                            In a paper by the professor Thomas Hodgson, recommendation systems create feedback loops that lean toward certain social categorizations and identities. 
                            He says that anthropologists “have likened this technological determinism to ‘herding’, ‘nudging’ and ‘captivating’ user attention, suggesting that boundaries between humans and machines are becoming increasingly blurred”. 
                            But to make personalization scalable, the demographics and data used to understand music preferences and taste becomes increasingly flattened. 
                            The nuances of personal recommendations are lost in the act of quantifying something so subjective.
                        </p>
                        <p class="palanquin-regular">
                            Music algorithms attempt to remedy this loss of nuance by incorporating audio analysis models to analyze the song tracks as mentioned earlier. 
                            Using audio analysis to identify similarities and differences between songs enhances the analysis achieved by collaborative filtering and empirical data of the songs. 
                            However, the issue that we are seeing is that when the algorithms do not have audio analysis models that cater to global music traditions, the effects of this homogenization hit these populations more. 
                            So while Western music becomes globally recognized, the same doesn’t happen for music from other countries and traditions.

                            These algorithms, now ubiquitous to everyone's lives, also shape listener behavior. 
                            This is illustrated in a study by MusicThinkTank cited in this article that found that “ 57% of listeners changed their music preferences after using algorithmic playlists” (Soundsm 2023). 
                            As more and more people get influenced by the algorithm, the art of discovering music and thereby broadening on’es horizons will be lost. 
                            This impact can transcend just music and contribute to homogenization of culture as a whole. 
                            Since the algorithms cannot determine whether the dataset they are trained on is biased or not cannot fix it without human intervention, they wield a lot of power to influence behavior that is left unchecked. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="palanquin-regular">
                            Not only does this affect listeners, it also affects musicians themselves as they are being forced to align with trends in order to get discovered. 
                            While they may not be explicitly discouraged from exploring and creating new music, an algorithm's impact on culture will influence their behavior to optimize their music for average public appeal which further contributes to the homogenization of culture. 
                            Without knowing how it works, users experience the black box issue of algorithms in general, where the process of how machine learning arrives at its conclusions is obscured from the public that interacts with it. 
                            Without knowing how these recommendations are made, users will not be able to fight to change it nor will they be able to conciously train their own algorithm, because they will not be able to break free from it.
